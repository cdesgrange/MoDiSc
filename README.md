# MoDiSc

MoDiSc (Modeling Disk in Scattered light) is a python package to model debris disk in scattered light. It was first used to constrain the morphology and the photometry of the debris disk HD 120326 (HIP 67497) imaged in total and polarized intensity with VLT/SPHERE data  in Desgrange et al. (2025).

The documentation of the code is available [here](https://modisc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The first few steps regarding installation, running MoDiSc on a few example cases are also written below.

If you would like new features implemented in MoDiSc for your work, feel free to contact me via email (celia.desgrange@eso.org). I will look into implementing them on a best-effort basis.

## Installation

First create a new environment to use MoDiSc.

> $ conda create -n modisc_env python=python3.9

Activate this environment

> $ conda activate modisc_env

Install MoDiSc via pip:

> $ pip install MoDiSc

The packages required by MoDiSc are indicated in MoDiSc/packages.py.
Most of the packages can be installed via 

> $ pip install [packagename]

**Exceptions:**

- opencv must be installed via $ pip install opencv-python

- emcee: the appropriate version of the emcee package to be used by MoDiSc is MoDiSc/emcee/

## Run MoDiSc

1. Go to the directory where you would like to run the simulations. Make sure to add the scripts run_modisc.py and plot_mcmc_results.py in this directory, and the folder "config_files/" in which are the configuration files of the simulations to be launched.

2. In the folder "config_files/", there are six example of simulations to be launched.

- job1 and job2 constrain the morphology of the debris disk HD 120326 based on SPHERE polarized intensity data at 1.6 $\mu$m (one observation), using a Nelder-Mead optimization (faster; job1) or a MCMC exploration (job2)

- job3 and job4 constrain the morphology of the debris disk HD 120326 based on SPHERE total intensity data at 1.6 $\mu$m (one observation), using a Nelder-Mead optimization (faster; job3) or a MCMC exploration (job4)

- job5 and job6 constrain the morphology of the debris disk HD 120326 based on SPHERE total and polarized intensity data at 1.6 $\mu$m (two observations in total), using a Nelder-Mead optimization (faster; job5) or a MCMC exploration (job6)

> python3 run_modisc.py config_files/job1_example_1obs_polarized_intensity_Nelder-Mead.yaml

3. Wait for the results! The results will be stored in results/*/beginning_date_of_the_simulation/final/. A logfile will be created and stored there, and a copy will also be added in the folder logs/, once the script finished to run.

4. If you run a simulation using a MCMC exploration, you can plot the cornerplot of the posteriors of the simulations by running

> python3 plot_mcmc_results.py config_files/job2_example_1obs_polarized_intensity_MCMC.yaml

the figures will be saved in results/*/beginning_date_of_the_simulation/results_mcmc/\*.pdf
