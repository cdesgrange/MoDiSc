MoDiSc stands for Modeling Disk in Scattered light. One can use the MoDiSc code to constrain the morphology and spectroscopy of a disk in scattered-light. It was originally used to model the total and polarized intensity data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument on the debris disk HD 120326 (HIP 67497) presented in Desgrange et al. (2025) subm.
