Welcome to MoDiSc's documentation!
===================================

**MoDiSc** is a Python library for debris disk enthusiasts.
MoDiSc (Modeling Disks in Scattered light) is designed to constrain the morphology and photometry of debris disks observed in scattered light. It supports both MCMC and Nelder-Mead optimization methods to determine the best-fit parameters for modeling the  disk.

Check out the :doc:`Installation and dependencies` section to install MoDiSc and the tutorials in ref:`Quick-start` to run it.
