Welcome to MoDiSc's documentation!
===================================

**MoDiSc** is a Python library for debris disks lovers.
MoDiSc (Modeling Disks in Scattered light) constrains the morphology and photometry of debris disks detected in scattered light. It uses MCMC or Nelder-Mead optimization to determine the best parameters to model the debris disk.

Check out the :doc:`Installation and dependencies` section to install MoDiSc and the tutorials in ref:`Quick-start` to run it.
